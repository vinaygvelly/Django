# Django
In Django, there are different ways to redirect a user to another page after they submit a form. One approach is to use the HttpResponseRedirect() function in the views.py file, while another approach is to specify the URL in the action attribute. 
This can be hardcoded or dynamic, depending on the specific use case. To implement a dynamic URL, the namespace and URL name must be known, which can be specified in the urls.py file of the relevant app. 
The index.html template file contains "Hello World!!", with the action attribute set to the dynamic URL using the {% url %} tag. After the user clciks the word, they will be redirected to the second page, which is defined in the urls.py file and rendered by the successpage view function in views.py. 
This template file then displays and confirms that it has been successfully received.

Overall, this process allows for a smooth and intuitive user experience when navigating between different pages in a Django application.
